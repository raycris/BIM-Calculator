# Calculator

 BMI (body mass index) calculator which will use a person's weight and height in order to calculate their body mass index as a number.
 
 Body mass index is calculated based off of the stored weight and height values. Our goal will be to calculated output their body mass index instantly, according to whatever values are stored in the weight and height state variables.

To do so, we will use the useMemo React hook to performantly calculate this value whenever either of these two values changed.
